Numbers -- print consecutive numbers
Write a function:
that, given a positive integer N, prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to N, each on a separate line. However, any number
divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should be replaced by the word Codility. Test or Coders respectively. Ifa number is divisible by more than
one of the numbers: 2,3 or 5. it should be replaced by a concatenation of the respective words Codility. Test and Coders in this
given order. For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be replac√©e by CodilityTest and numbers divisible by all
three numbers: 2,3 and 5, should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.
For example, here is the output for N = 24:
1
Codility
Test
Codility
Coders
CodilityTest
7
Codility
Test
CodilityCoders
11
CodilityTest
13
Codility
